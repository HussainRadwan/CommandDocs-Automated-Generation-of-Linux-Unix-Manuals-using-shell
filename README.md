# CommandDocs Automated Generation of Linux/Unix Manuals-using 
The primary goal of this project is to automate the generation of a comprehensive manual for Linux/Unix commands. This will be achieved through the development of scripts using Python or shell scripting. These scripts will create text files for each command, formatted according to a predefined template, which will facilitate consistent and efficient documentation.

## Code discription
This script automates the creation of documentation for Linux commands. It includes several functions to extract information about commands, verify documentation, and manage user interactions. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

### Core Functions:
##### 1.get_description:
- Retrieves the description of a command from its man page.
##### 2.get_name: 
- Extracts the command name from its man page.
##### 3.get_related_commands: 
- Finds related commands using keyword search in man pages.
##### 4.get_version: 
- Attempts to get the command version using common flags like --version.
##### 5.generate_documentation: 
- Generates a detailed documentation file for a command, including its name, description, version, example usage, and related commands.

### Documentation Generation:
- For each command, a text file is created containing structured information fetched by the aforementioned functions.
- If certain information (name, description, version) cannot be retrieved, placeholders are used.
- The script also handles the execution of an example command and captures its output, adding practical usage insights to the documentation.

### Verification Functions:
- #### verify_all_commands:
  Compares new documentation against existing files to detect changes.
- #### verify_specific_document:
  Allows verification of a specific command's documentation by comparing it against an existing file.

### User Interaction:
- suggest_commands: Recommends commands based on usage history.
- search_manuals: Provides options to search within command documentation.
- validate_command: Checks if a given command exists in the system.
- prompt_for_custom_command: Prompts users to enter a valid command name.
- create_manuals_for_selected_commands and create_manuals_for_custom_commands: Guides users through creating manuals for pre-defined or new custom commands.

### Workflow Management:
- initial_setup: Initially presents options to generate documentation for all commands, select specific commands, or input custom commands.
- A comprehensive main menu loop provides various functionalities, including verification of generated documentation, command recommendation, manual search, and adding manuals for custom commands, with the option to exit the program.
